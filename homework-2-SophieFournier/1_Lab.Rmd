## How to use this resource

This RMD follows the structure of Section 2.3 of ISL; https://www.statlearning.com/). 
Please open this document using RStudio and 
either (1) render it (e.g. knit; shift+command+K in MacOs) or (2) run line by line
(see code chunks below). The instructor have added comments
that should help students navigate the document. Please do get in touch with the
instructor if you have any questions. Relatively more advanced topics (e.g. loops,
functions, packaged) are briefly covered in the relevant lecture.


## Basic Commands
`R` uses functions to perform operations. To run a function called `funcname`, 
we type `funcname(input1, input2)`, where the inputs (or arguments) `input1` argument
and `input2` tell `R` how to run the function. A function can have any number
of inputs. For example, to create a vector of numbers, we use the function
`c()` (for concatenate). Any numbers inside the parentheses are joined together. 
The following command instructs R to join together the numbers `1, 3, 2`, and `5`, 
and to save them as a `vector` named `x`. When we type `x`, it vector gives us 
back the `vector`. Some functions can even pass arguments to other functions. If
you're interested in checking this out, I'd recommend reviewing the ellipsis
or `…`. This later aspect allows for tons of flexibility while working with
functions in `R`.

```{r}
x  <-  c(1 ,  3 ,  2 ,  5)
x
```

Note that, in your console, the `>` is not part of the command; rather, it is printed by `R` to indicate 
that it is ready for another command to be entered. In some cases, the line you're running in `R` is incomplete.
For instance, consider running a loop line by line (instead of selecting the entire loop). In this case,
`R` will simply wait until all the lines are run. If you'd like `R` to stop waiting for you to
run the rest of your command, use `esc` in the console.

Now, We can also save things to the environment using either `=` and `<-`:

```{r}
x = c(1, 6, 2)
x
y = c(1, 4, 3)
```

However, note that `<-` is generally preferred given that it indicates some direction.
There's been a lot of discussion around this. For this course, I would recommend
using `<-` to assign values, functions, etc to particular objects.

Now, let's focus on the console. Hitting the up arrow multiple times in the console will display the previous 
commands. Each of these commands can then be edited. This is useful since one often wishes to repeat 
a similar command. 

However, instead of working directly in the console (e.g. typing  lines of code one by one
and running them each time), please use either an `R script` or an `R markdown` file. These
two formats will help you save your progress, add comments, make your analyses reproducible,
among others. In RStudio, use `File`>`New file` to create these files. Once you're more used with
the RStudio environment (if you decide to stay), please check out how to create `Projects` and use
`git` and `GitHub` from within the software to be more organized.


Let's go back to the functions. Typing `?funcname` will always cause `R` to open a new help 
window with additional information about the function `funcname()`. There are 
tons of resources in the internet for many many different functions. If you cannot
find help within `R` for a given function, just do some independent research. Note that
if you're interested in checking the actual content of a function, you can simply run the
name of the function in the console (without parentheses). This "trick" will certainly help
improving the clarity over what the function actually does. You can then copy the contents
of the function, assign it to a new function and debug or make changes (if necessary). 
This may need some more extra work (e.g. nested functions etc) but it's a good start.


We can tell `R` to add two sets of numbers together. It will then add the first 
number from `x` to the first number from y, and so on. However, `x` and `y` should 
be the same length. We can check their length using the `length()` function.

```{r}
length(x)
length(y)
x + y
```


The `ls()` function allows us to look at a list of all of the objects, such as 
data and functions, that we have saved so far. The `rm()` function can be used to 
delete any that we don’t want. Note that there's a broom under the `Environment` in
`RStudio` with the same functionality. For a more selective cleaning, use change the
view from `List` to `Grid` in the drop-down menu right next to the broom (also under
`Environment`).
 
```{r}
ls()
rm(x, y)
ls()
```
 
 
It’s also possible to remove all objects at once:

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
```

The `matrix()` function can be used to create a matrix of numbers. Before
we use the `matrix()` function, we can learn more about it:


```{r}
?matrix
```


The help file reveals that the `matrix()` function takes a number of inputs,
but for now we focus on the first three: the data (the entries in the matrix), 
the number of rows, and the number of columns. Note that a matrix
can be seen as a group of `vectors` (columns). First, we create a simple matrix.

```{r}
x <- matrix(data = c(1, 2, 3, 4), nrow = 2, ncol = 2) 
x
```

Note that we could just as well omit typing `data=`, `nrow=`, and `ncol=` in the 
`matrix()` command above: that is, we could just type

```{r}
x <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4), 2, 2)
```

and this would have the same effect. However, it can sometimes be useful to 
specify the names of the arguments passed in, since otherwise `R` will assume 
that the function arguments are passed into the function in the same order 
that is given in the function’s help file. As this example illustrates, by 
default `R` creates matrices by successively filling in columns. Alternatively, 
the `byrow = TRUE` option can be used to populate the matrix in order of the rows.
It is always recommended to use the name of the arguments when running a given function.
That will certainly improve the quality of the code you're writing.

```{r}
matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4), 2, 2, byrow = TRUE)
```


Notice that in the above command we did not assign the matrix to a value such 
as `x.` In this case the matrix is printed to the screen but is not saved for 
future calculations. The `sqrt()` function returns the square root of each element
of a vector or matrix. The command `x^2` raises each element of `x` to the power `2`; 
any powers are possible, including fractional or negative powers.

```{r}
sqrt(x)
x^2
```

The `rnorm()` function generates a vector of random normal variables, with first
argument `n` the sample size. Each time we call this function, we will get a 
different answer. Here we create two correlated sets of numbers, `x` and `y`, and 
use the `cor()` function to compute the correlation between them. We will be using this
function a lot throughout the course. For instance, assume that you're interested in
simulating a given variable with a normal distribution or adding error to a certain
variable. 

```{r}
x <- rnorm(50)
y <- x + rnorm(50, mean = 50, sd = .1) 
cor(x, y)
```


By default, `rnorm()` creates standard normal random variables with a mean of `0`
and a standard deviation of `1`. However, the mean and standard deviation can 
be altered using the `mean` and `sd` arguments, as illustrated above. This will
be part of a HW. Sometimes we 
want our code to reproduce the exact same set of random numbers; we can use the 
`set.seed()` function to do this. The `set.seed()` function takes an (arbitrary) 
integer argument. This function is particularly useful when running simulations.
Please use it if you're interested in controlling some stochasticity in the numbers
you're generating.


```{r}
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- rnorm(100)
plot(x, y)
plot(x, y, xlab = "this is the x-axis",
     ylab = "this is the y-axis", main = "Plot of X vs Y")
```

We will often want to save the output of an `R` plot. The command that we use to
do this will depend on the file type that we would like to create. For instance,
to create a pdf, we use the `pdf()` function, and to create a `jpeg`, we use the 
`jpeg()` function.

```{r}
pdf("Figure.pdf")
plot(x, y, col = "green")
dev.off()
```

The function `dev.off()` indicates to R that we are done creating the plot. 
Alternatively, we can simply copy the plot window and paste it into an 
appropriate file type, such as a Word document. 

Some students might be interested in generating "better" plots. Please check out
the `ggplot2` `R` package! 

The function `seq()` can be used to create a sequence of numbers. For instance,
`seq(a, b)` makes a vector of integers between `a` and `b`. There are many other 
options: for instance, `seq(0, 1, length = 10)` makes a sequence of `10` numbers 
that are equally spaced between `0` and `1`. Typing `3:11` is a shorthand for 
`seq(3, 11)` for integer arguments.

```{r}
x <- seq(1, 10)
x
x <- 1:10
x
x <- seq(-pi, pi, length = 50)
x
```


Now, assume you're interested in sampling a `10` elements from our `x` vector:

```{r}
sample(x=x, size=10)
```

There's no replacement in this sampling and probabilities of being sampled are the
same across all the elements in x. Now, let's sample 100 elements from our latest `x`. In this case,
we will need to sample with replacement given that the length of `x` is 50. 

```{r}
sample(x=x, size=100, replace = T)
```

The `sample` function is central to many functions that re-sample datasets! You can even implement
your own bootstrapping function using `sample`.

Back to the plots. We will now create some more sophisticated plots. The `contour()` function 
produces a contour plot in order to represent three-dimensional data; it 
is like a topographical map. It takes three arguments:

1. A vector of the `x` values (the first dimension),
2. A vector of the `y` values (the second dimension), and
3. A matrix whose elements correspond to the `z` value (the third dimension) 
for each pair of `(x, y)` coordinates.

As with the `plot()` function, there are many other inputs that can be used to 
fine-tune the output of the `contour()` function. To learn more about these, 
take a look at the help file by typing `?contour`.

```{r}
y <- x
f <- outer(x, y, function(x, y) cos(y) / (1 + x^2)) 
contour(x, y, f)
contour(x, y, f, nlevels = 45, add = T)
fa <- (f - t(f)) / 2
contour(x, y, fa, nlevels = 15)
```

The `image()` function works the same way as `contour()`, except that it produces a 
color-coded plot whose colors depend on the z value. This is knownas a heatmap,
andissometimesusedtoplottemperatureinweather forecasts. Alternatively, `persp()` 
can be used to produce a three-dimensional plot. The arguments theta and phi 
control the angles at which the plot is viewed.


```{r}
image(x, y, fa) 
persp(x, y, fa) 
persp(x, y, fa, theta = 30)
persp(x, y, fa, theta = 30, phi = 20)
persp(x, y, fa, theta = 30, phi = 70)
persp(x, y, fa, theta = 30, phi = 40)
```


## Indexing data

We often wish to examine part of a set of data. The concept outlined below apply
to both data.frames and matrices. Suppose that our data is 
stored in the matrix `A`.

```{r}
A <- matrix(1:16, 4, 4)
A
```

Then, typing

```{r}
A[2, 3]
```

will select the element corresponding to the second row and the third column. 
The first number after the open-bracket symbol `[` always refers to the row, 
and the second number always refers to the column. We can also select multiple
rows and columns at a time, by providing vectors as the indices.


```{r}
A[c(1, 3), c(2, 4)]
A[1:3, 2:4]
A[1:2, ]
A[, 1:2]
```

The last two examples include either no index for the columns or no index for 
the rows. These indicate that `R` should include all columns or all rows, 
respectively. `R` treats a single row or column of a matrix as a vector.

```{r}
A[1, ]
```

The use of a negative sign `-` in the index tells `R` to keep all rows or columns 
except those indicated in the index.

```{r}
A[-c(1, 3), ]
A[-c(1, 3), -c(1, 3, 4)]
```

The `dim()` function outputs the number of rows followed by the number of columns 
of a given matrix.

```{r}
dim(A)
```

For lists, note that the structure is a bit different (nested patterns!). Let's
create a named list of two matrices with the same number of dimensions.

```{r}
l1 <- list('one'=matrix(1,2,3), 'two'=matrix(2,2,3))
```


We have two options to extract the first element of the list:
 
```{r}
l1$one
l1[[1]]
```



## Loading data

For most analyses, the first step involves importing a data set into `R.` The 
`read.table()` function is one of the primary ways to do this. The help file 
contains details about how to use this function. We can use the function 
`write.table()` to export data. Note that there's a ton of different functions
for reading data into R. `read.csv` is usually very flexible. Functions in 
`data.table` and other packages are efficient for reading huge datasets. In general,
if you're dealing with big datasets, use `R` outside of `RStudio` and find
memory-efficient packages!

Before attempting to load a data set, we must make sure that `R` knows to search 
for the data in the proper directory. For example, on a Windows system one 
could select the directory using the `Change dir. . .` option under the File menu.
However, the details of how to do this depend on the operating system 
(e.g. Windows, Mac, Unix) that is being used, and so we do not give further 
details here. In `RStudio`, check under `Session` > `Set working directory`>
`Choose directory` and select the folder where you're saving all the files
relevant to the Homework (or the project you're working on). In `RStudio`, you
can also load data by using the third icon in the `Environment` tab. Note that once
you've set your working directory, the path in `R` is going to be relative to
that directory. Check your current working directory using

```{r}
getwd()
```

You can also change it using:
```{r eval=FALSE}
setwd()
```

In R Markdown files, the working directory is always set to the location of the
.RMD file when rendering. Unless is extremely necessary, do not set the WD
in RMD files!


We begin by loading in the Auto data set from the book. This data is part of the ISLR2 
library, discussed in Chapter 3. To illustrate the `read.table()` function, 
we load it now from a text file, Auto.data, which you can find on the textbook 
website.We will load the data directly from a website. You can download the file as well
and read it from your local machine.

The following command will load the Auto.data file into `R` and store 
it as an object called `Auto`, in a format referred to as a data frame. Once the 
data has been loaded, the `View()` function can be used to view it in a 
spreadsheet-like window.1 The `head()` function can also be used to view the 
first few rows of the data. Note that `View()` is not very handy when you're using
Markdown files or when you're examining large datasets!

```{r}
Auto <- read.table("https://book.huihoo.com/introduction-to-statistical-learning/Auto.data", header = TRUE)
#View(Auto)
head(Auto)
```

Note that Auto.data is simply a text file, which you could alternatively 
open on your computer using a standard text editor. It is often a good idea 
to view a data set using a text editor or other software such as `Excel`
before loading it into `R`.


This particular data set has not been loaded correctly, because `R` has assumed 
that the variable names are part of the data and so has included them in the 
first row. The data set also includes a number of missing observations, 
indicated by a question mark `?`. Missing values are a common occurrence in 
real data sets. Using the option `header = T` (or `header = TRUE`) in the 
`read.table()` function tells R that the first line of the file contains the 
variable names, and using the option na.strings tells `R` that any time it 
sees a particular character or set of characters (such as a question mark),
it should be treated as a missing element of the data matrix.


```{r}
Auto <- read.table("https://book.huihoo.com/introduction-to-statistical-learning/Auto.data", header = T, na.strings = "?", stringsAsFactors = T)
#View(Auto)
```


The `stringsAsFactors = T` argument tells R that any variable containing 
character strings should be interpreted as a qualitative variable, and 
that each distinct character string represents a distinct level for that 
qualitative variable. An easy way to load data from Excel into `R` is to save 
it as a `csv` (comma-separated values) file, and then use the `read.csv()` function.


```{r}
Auto <- read.csv("https://book.huihoo.com/introduction-to-statistical-learning/Auto.data", na.strings = "?", stringsAsFactors = T)
#View(Auto)
dim(Auto)
Auto[1:4, ]
```


The `dim()` function tells us that the data has `397` observations, or rows, and 
nine variables, or columns. There are various ways to deal with the missing data. 
In this case, only five of the rows contain missing observations, and so we 
choose to use the `na.omit()` function to simply remove these rows.

```{r}
Auto <- read.table("https://book.huihoo.com/introduction-to-statistical-learning/Auto.data", header = T, na.strings = "?", stringsAsFactors = T)
Auto <- na.omit(Auto) 
dim(Auto)
```

Once the data are loaded correctly, we can use `names()` to check the variable 
names (column names).

```{r}
names(Auto)
```

## Additional Graphical and Numerical Summaries

We can use the `plot()` function to produce scatterplots of the quantitative 
variables. However, simply typing the variable names will produce an error 
message, because `R` does not know to look in the `Auto` data set for those variables.

```{r eval=FALSE}
plot(Auto$cylinders, Auto$mpg)
## Error in plot(cylinders, mpg) : object ‘cylinders’ not found
```

To refer to a variable, we must type the data set and the variable name joined 
with a `$` symbol. Alternatively, we can use the `attach()` function in order to 
tell `R` to make the variables in this data frame available by name.

```{r}
length(Auto$cylinders)
length(Auto$mpg)
plot(Auto$cylinders, Auto$mpg) 
attach(Auto)
plot(cylinders, mpg)
```

The `cylinders` variable is stored as a numeric vector, so `R` has treated it as 
quantitative. However, since there are only a small number of possible values
for `cylinders`, one may prefer to treat it as a qualitative variable. The 
`as.factor()` function converts quantitative variables into qualitative variables.

```{r}
Auto$cylinders <- as.factor(Auto$cylinders)
```

If the variable plotted on the x-axis is qualitative, then boxplots will 
automatically be produced by the `plot()` function. As usual, a number of options 
can be specified in order to customize the plots.


```{r}
plot(Auto$cylinders, Auto$mpg)
plot(Auto$cylinders, Auto$mpg, col = "red")
plot(Auto$cylinders, Auto$mpg, col = "red", varwidth = T)
plot(Auto$cylinders, Auto$mpg, col = "red", varwidth = T, horizontal = T)
plot(Auto$cylinders, Auto$mpg, col = "red", varwidth = T, xlab = "cylinders", ylab = "MPG")
```

The `hist()` function can be used to plot a histogram. Note that `col = 2` has 
the same effect as `col = "red"`.

```{r}
hist(Auto$mpg)
hist(Auto$mpg, col = 2)
hist(Auto$mpg, col = 2, breaks = 15)
```
 
The `pairs()` function creates a scatterplot matrix, i.e. a scatterplot for 
every pair of variables. We can also produce scatterplots for just a subset of the variables.

```{r}
pairs(Auto) 
pairs(~ mpg + displacement + horsepower + weight + acceleration, data = Auto)
```

In conjunction with the `plot()` function, `identify()` provides a useful 
interactive method for identifying the value of a particular variable 
for points on a plot. We pass in three arguments to `identify()`: the x-axis 
variable, the y-axis variable, and the variable whose values we would like 
to see printed for each point. Then clicking one or more points in the plot 
and hitting Escape will cause `R` to print the values of the variable of interest.
The numbers printed under the `identify()` function correspond to the rows for the selected points.

```{r}
plot(horsepower, mpg)
identify(horsepower, mpg, name)
```

The `summary()` function produces a numerical summary of each variable in
a particular data set.


```{r}
summary(Auto)
```

For qualitative variables such as name, `R` will list the number of observations 
that fall in each category. We can also produce a summary of just a single variable.

```{r}
summary(mpg)
```

Once we have finished using `R`, we type `q()` in order to shut it down, or quit.
When exiting `R`, we have the option to save the current workspace so that all 
objects (such as data sets) that we have created in this `R` session will be 
available next time. Before exiting `R`, we may want to save a record of all 
of the commands that we typed in the most recent session; this can be
accomplished using the `savehistory()` function. Next time we enter `R`, 
we can load that history using the `loadhistory()` function, if we wish. Sometimes
is also useful to save all the objects created in `R`. For this, check the 
`save()` or `save.image()` functions. I will ask for your workspace in at least one
of the assignments.
